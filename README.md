## CSS Grid Resume Template


:construction: WORK IN PROGRESS 


Deployed on GitHub pages [here](https://alpiepho.github.io/css-grid-resume/).

A concrete example of my own resume can be found [here](https://github.com/alpiepho/css-grid-resume-mine).

This is a responsive web application, with different formatting for various
size displays.  For Mobile, the site is displayed mostly veritical.  For
web browsers, it is a normal page with some action buttons (possibly a drop down in the furure).  For printing, the action buttons are removed, etc.

My hope is that the origianl template and this concrete example will be useful for others to copy/clone and add their own online resume.


## Background

The idea for this started from a blog post on CSS Tricks [here](https://css-tricks.com/new-year-new-job-lets-make-a-grid-powered-resume/).

As I was starting from that example, other sites/examples were found.  One that was
bven better is the code pen referenced.  It is layed out differently.

## My onging TODO List and Ideas

- consider using apline.js for any dynamic stuff https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine
- adjust based on media size
- change px to rem
- BONUS: easteregg animation
