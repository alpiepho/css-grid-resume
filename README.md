## CSS Grid Resume Template


:construction: WORK IN PROGRESS 


Deployed on GitHub pages [here](https://alpiepho.github.io/css-grid-resume/).



Example from https://css-tricks.com/new-year-new-job-lets-make-a-grid-powered-resume/

Even better is the code pen referenced.  It is layed out differently

## TODO

- build generic nested css-grid based on my resume
- consider using apline.js for any dynamic stuff https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine
- complete README.md to instruct how to leverage this project

- use https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54791658/vertical-divider-as-pseudo-element-with-css-grids
for seperators
- class "postseperator?"
- can I use css repeat instead of explicit grid items? not sure...more difficult to debug
- change px to rem
- combine _label and _hr
