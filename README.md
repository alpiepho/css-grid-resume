## CSS Grid Resume Template


:construction: WORK IN PROGRESS 


Deployed on GitHub pages [here](https://alpiepho.github.io/css-grid-resume/).



Example from https://css-tricks.com/new-year-new-job-lets-make-a-grid-powered-resume/

Even better is the code pen referenced.  It is layed out differently

## TODO

- build generic nested css-grid based on my resume
- consider using apline.js for any dynamic stuff https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine
- complete README.md to instruct how to leverage this project
- adjust based on media size
- change px to rem
- combine _label and _hr
- BONUS: stick animation...start with Code Pen
